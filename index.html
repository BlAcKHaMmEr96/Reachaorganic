                        Matcha is a finely ground powder made from specially grown and processed green tea leaves. It originated in China and was later developed in Japan, where it is mostly produced today. Matcha is unique because the tea plants are shade-grown for several weeks before harvest, which increases the production of theanine and caffeine. The leaves are then steamed, dried, and stone-ground into a fine powder1.

Matcha is known for its vibrant green color and rich, umami flavor. Unlike regular tea that is infused with water, matcha powder is mixed directly into the liquid, resulting in a beverage with a full-bodied taste.
